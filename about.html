    <div id="bio">
        <p>Daily planner was created by Drew Markham, a sophomore at Redwood High School and a member of the class of
            2027.
        </p>
        <p>Daily planner was built to streamline the process of planning your day. </p>
        <p>Drew often found himself unable to reach his peak productivity due to inneficient or low effort planning
            leading
            to procrastination and wasting time.</p>
        <p>Daily planner allows for a quick and easy way to create an easy to understand, and optimized schedule to make
            your day as easy as can be.</p
